This Agreement represents your understanding and acceptance of Pearson VUE’s Privacy and Cookies Policy (“Privacy Policy”), Terms and Conditions, and use of cookies to support your testing experience. You also understand, acknowledge and agree that the testing program sponsor has its own, possibly different, privacy policy.
OnVUE Data Processing
By providing your personal information, as described in our Privacy and Cookies Policy, you acknowledge and agree to the video and audio recording of your entire testing session and you agree to the processing of such personal information and test data by Pearson VUE and to the transfer of such data to Pearson VUE’s hub server, located in the USA, as the data processor, its authorized third parties, if any, both in the capacity as data processors for the processing of your personal information and test data on behalf of the testing program sponsor, as the data controller, located in the USA or elsewhere. Pearson VUE and other data processing entities, if any, are the recipients of your personal information and test data; however, Pearson VUE will enter into reasonable data transfer agreements with such entities for the purpose of communicating and following the instructions of your testing program sponsor and for establishing reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your personal information and test data.
 If you choose to take the test through our online-proctoring platform, which is not mandatory in the event that there are other ways of taking the test as determined by the testing program sponsor, you and your computer will be monitored during your entire testing session in real time so that your face, voice, desk, and workspace will be captured and possibly recorded for the purposes of test quality, test security, and the integrity of the testing process. You understand, acknowledge and agree that you will be monitored at your location through audio, technology and video means so all activity at your location will be detectable by test proctors. By accessing this website you signify your acknowledgement and agreement that any inappropriate or wrongful conduct, as determined in Pearson VUE’s or the test proctor’s sole discretion, witnessed while monitoring your testing session will be reported by Pearson VUE to the testing program sponsor and may also be reported to the appropriate governmental authorities, including, but not limited to, any law enforcement officials.
Third Party Prohibition
By accessing this website you signify that you understand, acknowledge and agree that if any third party is: 1) detected as being present in your physical location, whether visible or not; or 2) overheard in any manner, whether physically detected through movement and making of noise or through sounds irrespective of whether they are in your current location or not during your testing session, the test will be terminated and you will not receive any score. Further, you understand, acknowledge and agree that if your testing session is terminated for this or any other reason you will not receive a test fee refund, credit or voucher.
Limited License

Before the exam:

Visit the AWS Online Proctoring page and review information on exam policies and procedures, OnVUE technical requirements, and the System Test.
Complete the required System Test from the same computer and in the same location you'll be using on exam day. *Corporate firewalls often cause issues while trying to take your exam. Please consider taking your exam in a setting without a corporate firewall.*
It is crucial that you review the OnVUE technical requirements and run the System Test on this webpage (https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue) prior to your exam to minimize the risk of technical issues you may experience.

Examples of acceptable identification:

Passport
Driver's license
Identification card (national or local)
Registration card (such as green card, permanent resident, visa)

The first name/given name and the last name/surname must be identical to the first and last names on the valid forms of identification that you are required to present at your exam appointment or you will not be permitted to test.
